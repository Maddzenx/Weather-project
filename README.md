# Weather-project (API)

Language: Python\

This file consists of three programs:
1. hour_program: Returns the weather forecast in the upcoming 12 hour with 3-hour intervals
2. nearby_cities: Returns the cities near a given location
3. ozone_level: Returns the current and forecast ozone level in the air in a given certain location

(There is a "bonus" program called "weather" that combines all of the three program into one. 
Note that the bonus program will not stop running efter if the user input is invalid.
It will continue to run the whole program. The bonus program can be improved regarding bug management.) 

To run this project, follow these steps:
1. Download the zip-file to your computer
2. Unzip the file and open in Visual Code Studio
3. Choose one of the three files (hour_program.py, nearby_cities.py or ozone_level.py) and run the program
   The terminal will then give you hints on the expected input from you :)
